"""
Imagine that you are monitoring changes to user ratings for an online platform.
Each user on this platform has an overall rating (an integer between 1 and 2500)
and a corresponding level. Rating levels are based on the following rules:

    - rating < 1000           = "beginner"
    - 1000 <= rating < 1500   = "intermediate"
    - 1500 <= rating < 2000   = "advanced"
    - 2000 <= rating          = "pro"

You are given an `initial` rating value and an array of integers `changes`
representing changes to the rating. Your task is to calculate the final rating
and return the level corresponding to that rating.

It is guaranteed that changes to the rating value will never result in it
becoming less than 1 or greater than 2500.

Note: You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution
with time complexity not worse than O(changes.length^2) will fit within the
execution time limit.

Example:

    - For initial = 1500 and changes = [-100, -300, 450, 500, -500, -600],
      the output should be solution(initial, changes) = "beginner".

      Explanation: The rating changes as follows:
        1500 -> 1400 -> 1100 -> 1550 -> 2050 -> 1550 -> 950.
      The final rating value of 950 is in the range of the "beginner" level.

    - For initial = 1000 and changes = [100, 200, 300, 400, -500],
      the output should be solution(initial, changes) = "advanced".

      Explanation: The rating changes as follows:
        1000 -> 1100 -> 1300 -> 1600 -> 2000 -> 1500.
      The final rating value of 1500 is in the range of the "advanced" level.
